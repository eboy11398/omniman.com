    </button>

    <p>
        This is just another website I made for fun. I'm quite hsppy that I figured out how to make the button change to another image, and then back to the original 
        image if it detects in JavaScript that the other image is showing. It took a long time for me to wrap my head around some stuff like CSS alignment, and stuff 
        in JS, but all in all it's good shit. Anyway, I'll be testing out what I can do with background images if you scroll further down. So to fill up space there I put in some stickers
        if you want to use it.
